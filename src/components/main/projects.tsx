            This was a project I brought together at the end of the taught phase
            of my Academy training. I wanted to combine making a portfolio with
            producing a genuine full-stack app and work with some other concepts
            that I felt I hadn't spent enough time on in the taught course. I
            wanted to focus on having a tight front-end that utilised good
            responsive styling. In futher development, I'm going to build a full
